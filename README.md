# SimpleSudokuSolver

This program solves a Sudoku puzzle.
It takes an input file to read in a board, solves the puzzle, and prints the finished board.
As of right now, it is not complete. It can only solves puzzles that don't require guessing.


Input file consists of a 9x9 grid of numbers representing a Sudoku board.

Sample text for input file:

9 x 5 6 x 4 3 x x
1 4 7 x x x 8 x x
x x x 1 x 7 9 x 4
x 3 x 9 x 5 1 8 x
4 x x 3 x x x x x
7 5 x x 2 1 x x x
x x 4 x x x 6 3 5
8 1 x 5 6 2 x x x
x x x x x 9 x 1 8

An x represents an empty space (although it can be any non Integer value)
